PHP - Delphi interface and PHP extensions development framework                  

{ $Id: readme.txt,v 7.0 04/2007 delphi32 Exp $ } 

PHP4Delphi is a Delphi interface to PHP for Delphi 5, 6, 7, Delphi 2005, Delphi 2006 and Delphi 2007.

PHP4Delphi consists of 3 big subprojects:

1. PHP scripting (using php as a scripting language in Delphi applications)
PHP4Delphi allows to execute the PHP scripts within the Delphi program using 
TpsvPHP component directly without a WebServer. 
It is a PHP extension that enables you to write client-side GUI applications. 
One of the goals behind it was to prove that PHP is a capable general-purpose scripting 
language that is suited for more than just Web applications. 
It is used by "Delphi for PHP" from CodeGear.

2. PHP extensions development framework (using Delphi to extend PHP functionality)
Visual Development Framework gives possibility to create custom PHP
Extensions using Delphi. 
PHP extension, in the most basic of terms, is a set of instructions that is
designed to add functionality to PHP.

3. PHP4Applications (integrate PHP in any application)
Supports C, C++, Visual Basic, VBA, C#, Delphi, Delphi .NET, Visual Basic .NET etc. 


More detail information available in php4Delphi manual php4Delphi.pdf


This is a source-only release of php4Delphi. It includes
designtime and runtime packages for Delphi 5 through Delphi 2007.

Before using php4Delphi library:

If you have no PHP installed, you have to download and 
install PHP separately. It is not included in the package.
You can download the latest version of PHP from
http://www.php.net/downloads.php

ZEND API documentation available at http://www.zend.com
PHP  API documentation available at http://www.php.net

You need to ensure that the dlls which php uses can be found. 
php4ts.dll is always used. If you are using any php extension dlls then you
will need those as well. 
To make sure that the dlls can be found, you can either copy them to the 
system directory (e.g. winnt/system32 or  windows/system).

Copy the file, php.ini-dist to your %WINDOWS% directory on
Windows 95/98 or to your %SYSTEMROOT% directory under Windows NT,
Windows 2000 or Windows XP and rename it to php.ini. Your %WINDOWS% or
%SYSTEMROOT% directory is typically:
c:\windows for Windows 95/98
c:\winnt or c:\winnt40 for NT/2000/XP servers

Since this is a freeware you are strongly encouraged to look 
at the source code and improve on the components if you want to. 
Of course I would appreciate it if you would send me back the 
changes and bug fixes you have made.
