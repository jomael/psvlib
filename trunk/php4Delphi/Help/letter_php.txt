Hi,

php4delphi is not a component for  server -side development. It is a scripting for applications (like VBA for Office). It is a PHP
extension that enables you to write client-side _GUI_  applications.
One of the goals behind it was to prove that PHP is a capable general-purpose scripting language that is suited for more than just Web
applications. It is intended for creating standalone GUI applications.

If you want to use PHP within your application you can use Indy idHTTPServer and
idISAPIRunner + php4Isapi or idCGIRunner + php.exe
You will have exactly the same results as using IIS or Apache

With php4Delphi you can use delphi forms instead of web-forms, pass parameters to script directly, without using GET and POST
(There are no such a thing without web-server, isn't it?)

Of course, because in normal situation server is responsible ro running a script
